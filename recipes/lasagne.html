    <h1>Lasagne Recipe</h1>

    <h2>The final product...</h2>
    <p>This is an adaptation of the official lasagne from the Bolognese<br>
        Chamber of Commerce. I've made a couple of changes suggested to me <br>
        by people from the area, such as which meat and wine to use or if <br>
        there should be milk added or not. One thing never in question, though,<br>
        is the green lasagne sheets. These are a must. The ragu is an authentic<br>
        sauce, simple without garlic or herbs and spices. Using fresh pasta keeps <br>
        you from having to pre-boil it.</p>

    <h2><strong>Ingredients list</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (3 ounce) package pancetta, minced</li>
            <li>Â½ cup diced carrot</li>
            <li>1/2 cup diced celery</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of yellow onion</li>
            <li>7 ounces ground pork</li>
            <li>6 ounces ground pork</li>
            <li>1/2 cup red wine</li>
        </ul>


    <h2><strong>Instructions</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Saute pancetta in a large stockpot over medium-high heat until fat has<br>
                 rendered, 1 to 2 minutes. Add carrot, celery, onion, and oil. Cook and<br>
                  stir until vegetables have softened and onion is translucent, about 5 <br>
                  minutes. Add beef and pork. Cook, stirring and mashing meat into small <br>
                  crumbles, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes more. </li>
            <li>Stir wine into the stockpot and bring to a boil. Add tomato sauce and stir;<br>
                 pour in 1 cup broth. Reduce heat to low and partially cover the pot to allow<br>
                  steam to escape. Simmer sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Pour 1 more cup of broth into the sauce. Continue simmering until thick,<br>
                 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add more broth only if absolutely necessary; ragu should drop,<br>
                  not run, off a spoon..</li>

        </ol>
